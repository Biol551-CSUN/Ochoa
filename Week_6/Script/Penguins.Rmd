# Intro 

Today we are going to work with penguin data to learn *RMarkdown*. 

# Load Libraries 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
library(tidyverse) ## ^ hides warning and messages in output 
library(here) 
library(palmerpenguins) 
# need to include space after # and before title 
## knitting is to view but don't forget to run code
``` 

# Inspect the data 
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% ## using penguin data set 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, ## length 
             y= bill_depth_mm, ## depth
             color = species)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
```
